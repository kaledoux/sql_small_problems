SQL consists of 3 different sublanguages.
For example, one of these sublanguages is called the Data Control Language (DCL)
component of SQL. It is used to control access to a database; it is responsible
for defining the rights and roles granted to individual users.
Common SQL DCL statements include:

REVOKE
GRANT

Name and define the remaining 2 sublanguages, and give at least 2 examples of each.

# Data Definition Language - used to create and modify the schema of a
data base.
Ex: CREATE ALTER DROP
# Data Manipulation Language - used to query and modify the data of a db
Ex: SELECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE
